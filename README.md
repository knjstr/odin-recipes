The Odin Project: Project #1: Recipes (HTML)
2/22/22

This project is using HTML strictly. I hope by the end of this project I can have a really good foundation of HTML so I can really focus on CSS and start Javascript.
I'm going to be finding recipes off budgetbytes.com, a website showing recipes for people on a budget.
